# Welcome to opendata-info!

This Github project contains information about Open Data and especially Austria. You will also find information about other countries too. If you find your contry missing, why not add the information? Feel free to share what you know!

This project tries to combine the most important information about Open Data in general and specific data for each and every country in one single place. In the future, this will hopefully serve as a central knowledge base for people interested in Open Data.

The information found in this project can also be found on the corresponding [WIKI](https://github.com/medman506/opendata-info/wiki).
