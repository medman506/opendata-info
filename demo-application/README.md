# Demo Application

A working implementation can be found on <http://opendatainfo.pfiff.me>.

## Charts and Graphs <http://opendatainfo.pfiff.me/index.html>:
This code demonstrates how to use the CKAN API of several different OGD Portals to download datasets and receive information from those portals. In this specific case, information about the number of available datasets and categories is used to create a dynamic visualisation of the current status of the austrian, german and swiss OGD Portals.

## CSV Demo <http://opendatainfo.pfiff.me/demo.html>:
To demonstrate how easy the usage of Open Data is, information about ideas for the austrian OGD Portal which is available in CSV format is processed in JS and added to the Webpage as HTML code. 

Following libraries are used:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/): Framework for general styling and easy implementation of responsive design
* [jquery](https://jquery.com/): Probably the most well known JS library
* [jquery-csv](https://github.com/evanplaice/jquery-csv): JS Tool to parse CSV data
* [canvas-js](http://canvasjs.com/): Simple and beautiful dynamic graphs and charts
