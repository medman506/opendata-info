# data.gv.at

[data.gv.at](https://www.data.gv.at/) is the official Open Government Data Portal of Austria and the single point of access for the [European Data Portal](http://www.europeandataportal.eu/). Even though data.gv.at is the official Austrian Open Data Portal, it collects most of its datasets from regional Open Data Portals like [Open Data Vienna](https://open.wien.gv.at/site/open-data/) or portals of governmental agencies like [Statistik Austria](http://data.statistik.gv.at/web/). 

The Portal uses [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), a Data Portal Software developed especially for Open Data. This software is developed by the OKFN and distributed as *Open Source*. 

Currently, **2114 Datasets** are listed in **14 Categories**. The most frequently used Datasets are the official [Austrian Map](https://basemap.at/) and other *Location Data*. Overall **37 Organisations** published their Datasets on data.gv.at. The datasets include Location Data, Weather Data but also statistics and election results. Overall, **107 different Data Formats** are currently in use, with *CSV* beeing the most frequent used format.
