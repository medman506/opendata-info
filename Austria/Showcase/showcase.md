# Showcase

Within this section, some austrian applications which use Open Government Data are presented. 
They are all featured on data.gv.at and use Datasets from data.gv.at or opendataportal.at
For an more detailed about each project, see the paper. 

## [OGD App Observatory](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/ogd-app-observatory/) 
This is an app which uses the metadata from the datasets and applications on data.gv.at 
By selecting the checkboxes from different categories (Plattform, type of app, type of data used,...),
this tool creates a Venn Diagram. This diagram can be used to answer certain questions on the data and apps available on data.gv.at.

## [Open Data Browser Austria](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/open-data-browser-austria/)
The Open Data Browser is an Windows 8 app which uses the API of data.gv.at to display the datasets. 
The advantage of this browser is the integrated preview of certain data formats.

## [Pendlerrechner](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/pendlerrechner/)
The "Pendlerrechner" is the official Application to calculate your possible Tax Reduction if you have to commute between home and to your place of work. In German, this is called "pendeln", hence the name Pendlerrechner (Commute-Calculator).

## [Zone Graz - parking](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/zone-graz/)
With this handy app, you know ecactly where all carparks in Graz are located. 
Furthermore, it shows you information about the carparks as well as the different parking zones in Graz.
You can also save and share your location once you found a parking spot, so you may not get lost when trying to find your car.

## [Toilet Map Vienna](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/toilet-map-vienna-augmented-reality-app/) and [Toilet Rating](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/toilet-rating-2/)
Both, Toilet Map and Toilet Rating aim to improve your experience when 'doing the business'. The Map guides you to the next available public toilet (even in Augmented Reality!).
With Toilet Rating, you can determine on which toilet you want to go. Ever had a 'shitty' experience? Now you can warn other user from specific toilets.

## [Open Data Mashup: Kleines Gluecksspiel und Schulen](https://www.data.gv.at/anwendungen/open-data-mashup-zum-kleinen-gluecksspiel-und-schulen/)
This mashup is pretty interesting, since it combines two different datasets to generate new Information. 
It shows the locations of schools and slot machines ("Kleines Gluecksspiel"). Since slot machines are prohibited within 150m of schools, this tool can be used to show which slot machines are located within those prohibited areas.
