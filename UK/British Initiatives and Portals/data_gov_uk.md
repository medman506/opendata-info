# data.gov.uk

Unlike other data portals, [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) is more advanced. It offers a Query Builder and a 'Request Data' section. Furthermore, there are a lot more datasets available than on other data portals. Another difference between data.gov.uk and other OGD Portals is the usage of non-open licenses. Some datasets contain explicit permission to be used in commercial projects.

Data is published by **10 Organisations** and the most datasets originate from the *Uk Hydrographic Office* and *Natural England*.
