# govdata.de

[govdata.de](https://www.govdata.de/) is the official OGD Portal in Germany. Data is not just stored there, but also harvested from other german OGD Portals. govdata.de is built upon CKAN, an Open Source - Data Portal Software. Like the austrian data.gv.at, govdata.de acts as a single point of access to the European Data Portal. 

As of now, **14 Categories** contain **19015 Datasets**, which are released by **23 Organisations**. The category containing the most datasets is *Geography, Geology and Geodata*, which contains 5059 datasets. The organisations which published the most datasets are the *City of Hamburg* and *Rheinland-Pfalz*. Unlike on other Open Data Portals, only **10 Formats** can be found on govdata.de, with *CSV* beeing the most frequently used data format.
